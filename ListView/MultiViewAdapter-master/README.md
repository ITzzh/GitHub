Helper library for recyclerviews to create composable view holders without boilerplate code.

## Gradle Dependency

The Gradle dependency is available via [JCenter](https://bintray.com/devahamed/MultiViewAdapter/multi-view-adapter/view).
JCenter is the default maven repository used by Android Studio.

The minimum API level supported by this library is API 9.

```gradle
dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.devahamed:multi-view-adapter:1.2.2'
    
    // If you want to use data binding
    compile 'com.github.devahamed:multi-view-adapter-databinding:1.2.2'
}
```


## Why this library?

Most of the android apps out there uses recyclerview to display content. 
As with any other system-level api, recyclerview api is also designed in a generic way. 
So it needs lot of code to be written for displaying a simple list. And it doubles, if you need to display multiple view types.
MultiViewAdapter library helps you in removing this boilerplate code while allowing you to truly re-use the viewholder code across various adapters.

There are many other libraries, which provides the same feature. But they do enforce the either or all of the following constraints :

1. Your POJO classes should extend/implement some Base classes. This forces us to make changes in model level.
2. Forces you to implement some boilerplate code - like managing view types by yourself.
3. Doesn't utilise diffutil or payloads from recyclerview api

Now the advantages of the MultiViewAdapter

1. No restrictions on POJO class' parent/hierarchy. Now, your model classes can truly reside inside data layer.
2. No need to cast your models, no need for switch/if-else cases when you are having multiple view types.
3. Takes advantage of diffutil and allows payload while notifying adapter.

## Key concepts

1. RecyclerAdapter - This is the adapter class. It can have multiple ItemBinder and DataManagers. It extends from official RecyclerView.Adapter
2. ItemBinder - ItemBinder's responsibility is to create and bind viewholders. ItemBinder has type parameter which accepts the  model class need to be displayed. ItemBinder needs to be registered inside RecyclerAdapter. ItemBinder can be registered with multiple adapters.
3. DataManger - Consider it as a List<E>. But internally it calls necessary animations when the list is modified. There are two DataManagers. <b>DataListManager</b> for list of items. <b>DataItemManager</b> for a single item (Header, Footer etc.,).

## File Templates

This library has default file templates for creating Adapters, ItemBinders for given model name. Take a look at wiki page for using the file templates. [Wiki page](https://github.com/DevAhamed/MultiViewAdapter/wiki/File-Templates)

## Usage
Let us display list of cars. No fuss. Here is the entire code.


<b>CarBinder</b>
 
```java
class CarBinder extends ItemBinder<CarModel, CarBinder.CarViewHolder> {

  @Override public CarViewHolder create(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup parent) {
    return new CarViewHolder(inflater.inflate(R.layout.item_car, parent, false));
  }

  @Override public boolean canBindData(Object item) {
    return item instanceof CarModel;
  }

  @Override public void bind(CarViewHolder holder, CarModel item) {
    // Bind the data here
  }

  static class CarViewHolder extends BaseViewHolder<CarModel> {
    // Normal ViewHolder code
  }
}
```

<b>In your Activity/Fragment</b>

```java
class CarListActivity extends Activity {

  private RecyclerView recyclerView;
  private List<CarModel> cars;

  public void initViews() {
    SimpleRecyclerAdapter<CarModel, CarBinder> adapter =
        new SimpleRecyclerAdapter<>(new CarBinder());

    recyclerView.setAdapter(adapter);
    adapter.setDataList(cars);
  }
}
```
Now you are good to go.
